Checking out every six pack.

**Solution 1**

    def isSelfCrossing(self, x):
        return any(d >= b > 0 and (a >= c or a >= c-e >= 0 and f >= d-b)
                   for a, b, c, d, e, f in ((x[i:i+6] + [0] * 6)[:6]
                                            for i in xrange(len(x))))

**Solution 2**

    def isSelfCrossing(self, x):
        b = c = d = e = 0
        for a in x:
            if d >= b > 0 and (a >= c or a >= c-e >= 0 and f >= d-b):
                return True
            b, c, d, e, f = a, b, c, d, e
        return False

**Explanation**

                b                              b
       +----------------+             +----------------+

       |                |             |                | a
     c |                |           c |                |
       |                | a           |                |    f
       +----------->    |             |                | <----+
                d       |             |                |      | e
                        |             |                       |
                                      +-----------------------+
                                                   d

Draw a line of length `a`. Then draw further lines of lengths `b`, `c`, etc. How does the `a`-line get crossed? From the left by the `d`-line or from the right by the `f`-line, see the above picture. I just encoded the criteria for actually crossing it.

Two details:

- In both cases, `d` needs to be at least `b`. In the first case to cross the `a`-line directly, and in the second case to get behind it so that the `f`-line can cross it. So I factored out `d >= b`.
- The "special case" of the `e`-line stabbing the `a`-line from below is covered because in that case, the `f`-line "crosses" it (note that even if there is no actual `f`-line, my code uses `f = 0` and thus still finds that "crossing").
