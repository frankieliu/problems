#
# Given a binary search tree with non-negative values, find the minimum
# absolute difference between values of any two nodes.
# 
# Example:
# 
# 
# Input:
# 
# ⁠  1
# ⁠   \
# ⁠    3
# ⁠   /
# ⁠  2
# 
# Output:
# 1
# 
# Explanation:
# The minimum absolute difference is 1, which is the difference between 2 and 1
# (or between 2 and 3).
# 
# 
# 
# 
# Note: There are at least two nodes in this BST.
# 
#
# Definition for a binary tree node.

#         self.left = None
#         self.right = None
