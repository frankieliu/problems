C++ Bit Manipulation + DFS solution

The key idea of my solution is to preprocess the dictionary to transfer all the words to bit sequences (int):
Pick the words with same length as target string from the dictionary and compare the characters with target. If the characters are different, set the corresponding bit to 1, otherwise, set to 0.
Ex: "abcde", ["abxdx", "xbcdx"] => [00101, 10001]

The problem is now converted to find a bit mask that can represent the shortest abbreviation, so that for all the bit sequences in dictionary, mask & bit sequence > 0.
Ex: for [00101, 10001], the mask should be [00001]. if we mask the target string with it, we get "****e" ("4e"), which is the abbreviation we are looking for.

To find the bit mask, we need to perform DFS with some optimizations. But which bits should be checked? We can perform "or" operation for all the bit sequences in the dictionary and do DFS for the "1" bits in the result.
Ex: 00101 | 10001 = 10101, so we only need to take care of the 1st, 3rd, and 5th bit.

Here is a C++ implementation, the running time should be about 3ms. Any suggestions would be appreciated.

```
class Solution {
    int n, cand, bn, minlen, minab;
    vector<int> dict;
    
    // Return the length of abbreviation given bit sequence
    int abbrLen(int mask) {
        int count = 0;
        for (int b = 1; b < bn;) {
            if ((mask & b) == 0)
                for (; b < bn and (mask & b) == 0; b <<= 1);
            else b <<= 1;
            count ++;
        }
        return count;
    }

    // DFS backtracking
    void dfs(int bit, int mask) {
        int len = abbrLen(mask);
        if (len >= minlen) return;
        bool match = true;
        for (auto d : dict) {
            if ((mask & d) == 0) {
                match = false;
                break;
            }
        }
        if (match) {
            minlen = len;
            minab = mask;
        }
        else
            for (int b = bit; b < bn; b <<= 1)
                if (cand & b) dfs(b << 1, mask + b);
    }

public:
    string minAbbreviation(string target, vector<string>& dictionary) {
        n = target.size(), bn = 1 << n, cand = 0, minlen = INT_MAX;
        string res;
        
        // Preprocessing with bit manipulation
        for (auto w : dictionary) {
            int word = 0;
            if (w.size() != n) continue;
            for (int i = n-1, bit = 1; i >= 0; --i, bit <<= 1)
                if (target[i] != w[i]) word += bit;
            dict.push_back(word);
            cand |= word;
        }
        dfs(1, 0);

        // Reconstruct abbreviation from bit sequence
        for (int i = n-1, pre = i; i >= 0; --i, minab >>= 1) {
            if (minab & 1) {
                if (pre-i > 0) res = to_string(pre-i) + res;
                pre = i - 1;
                res = target[i] + res;
            }
            else if (i == 0) res = to_string(pre-i+1) + res;
        }
        return res;
    }
};
```
**UPDATE**: a better way to determine the length of abbreviation mentioned by @StefanPochmann 
```
int abbrLen(int mask) {
    int count = n;
    for (int b = 3; b < bn; b <<= 1)
        if ((mask & b) == 0)
            count --;
    return count;
}
```
