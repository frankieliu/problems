What does come to your mind first when you see this sentence ```"corresponding bits are different"```? Yes, ```XOR```! Also, do not forget there is a decent function Java provided: ```Integer.bitCount()``` ~~~
```
public class Solution {
    public int hammingDistance(int x, int y) {
        return Integer.bitCount(x ^ y);
    }
}
```
