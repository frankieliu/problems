#
# Given a list of words (without duplicates), please write a program that
# returns all concatenated words in the given list of words.
# A concatenated word is defined as a string that is comprised entirely of at
# least two shorter words in the given array.
# 
# Example:
# 
# Input:
# ["cat","cats","catsdogcats","dog","dogcatsdog","hippopotamuses","rat","ratcatdogcat"]
# 
# Output: ["catsdogcats","dogcatsdog","ratcatdogcat"]
# 
# Explanation: "catsdogcats" can be concatenated by "cats", "dog" and "cats";
# "dogcatsdog" can be concatenated by "dog", "cats" and "dog"; "ratcatdogcat"
# can be concatenated by "rat", "cat", "dog" and "cat".
# 
# 
# 
# Note:
# 
# The number of elements of the given array will not exceed 10,000 
# The length sum of elements in the given array will not exceed 600,000. 
# All the input string will only include lower case letters.
# The returned elements order does not matter.
