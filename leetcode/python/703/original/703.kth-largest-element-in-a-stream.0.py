#
# Design a class to find the kth largest element in a stream. Note that it is
# the kth largest element in the sorted order, not the kth distinct element.
# 
# Your KthLargest class will have a constructor which accepts an integer k and
# an integer array nums, which contains initial elements from the stream. For
# each call to the method KthLargest.add, return the element representing the
# kth largest element in the stream.
# 
# Example:
# 
# 
# int k = 3;
# int[] arr = [4,5,8,2];
# KthLargest kthLargest = new KthLargest(3, arr);
# kthLargest.add(3);   // returns 4
# kthLargest.add(5);   // returns 5
# kthLargest.add(10);  // returns 5
# kthLargest.add(9);   // returns 8
# kthLargest.add(4);   // returns 8
# 
# 
# Note: 
# You may assume that nums' length ≥ k-1 and k ≥ 1.
#

class KthLargest:

    def __init__(self, k, nums):
        """
        :type k: int
        :type nums: List[int]

    def add(self, val):
        """
        :type val: int
        :rtype: int
        """
        


# Your KthLargest object will be instantiated and called as such:
# obj = KthLargest(k, nums)
# param_1 = obj.add(val)
