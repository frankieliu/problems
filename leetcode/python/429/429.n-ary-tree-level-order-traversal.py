# Given an n-ary tree, return the level order traversal of its nodes' values.
# (ie, from left to right, level by level).
# 
# For example, given a 3-ary tree:
# 
# 
# 
# 
# 
# 
# 
# We should return its level order traversal:
# 
# 
# [
# ⁠    [1],
# ⁠    [3,2,4],
# ⁠    [5,6]
# ]
# 
# 
# 
# 
# Note:
# 
# 
# The depth of the tree is at most 1000.
# The total number of nodes is at most 5000.
