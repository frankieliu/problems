Three different implementations of the same algorithm, taking advantage of different strengths of the three languages. I suggest reading all three, even if you don't know all three languages.

All three of course work swap the current node with the next node by rearranging pointers, then move on to the next pair, and repeat until the end of the list.

**C++**

Pointer-pointer `pp`  points to the pointer to the current node. So at first, `pp` points to `head`, and later it points to the `next` field of ListNodes. Additionally, for convenience and clarity, pointers `a` and `b` point to the current node and the next node.

We need to go from `*pp == a -> b -> (b->next)` to `*pp == b -> a -> (b->next)`. The first three lines inside the loop do that, setting those three pointers (from right to left). The fourth line moves `pp` to the next pair.

    ListNode* swapPairs(ListNode* head) {
        ListNode **pp = &head, *a, *b;
        while ((a = *pp) && (b = a->next)) {
            a->next = b->next;
            b->next = a;
            *pp = b;
            pp = &(a->next);
        }
        return head;
    }

**Python**

Here, `pre` is the previous node. Since the head doesn't have a previous node, I just use `self` instead. Again, `a` is the current node and `b` is the next node.

To go from `pre -> a -> b -> b.next` to `pre -> b -> a -> b.next`, we need to change those three references. Instead of thinking about in what order I change them, I just change all three at once.

    def swapPairs(self, head):
        pre, pre.next = self, head
        while pre.next and pre.next.next:
            a = pre.next
            b = a.next
            pre.next, b.next, a.next = b, a, b.next
            pre = a
        return self.next

**Ruby**

Again, `pre` is the previous node, but here I create a dummy as previous node of the head. And again, `a` is the current node and `b` is the next node. This time I go one node further and call it `c`.

To go from `pre -> a -> b -> c` to `pre -> b -> a -> c`, we need to change those three references. Here I chain the assignments, pretty much directly saying "`pre` points to `b`, which points to `a`, which points to `c`".

    def swap_pairs(head)
        pre = dummy = ListNode.new 0
        pre.next = head
        while a = pre.next and b = a.next
            c = b.next
            ((pre.next = b).next = a).next = c
            pre = a
        end
        dummy.next
    end
