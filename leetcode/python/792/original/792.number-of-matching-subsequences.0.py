# Testcase Example:  '"abcde"\n["a","bb","acd","ace"]'
#
# Given string S and a dictionary of words words, find the number of words[i]
# that is a subsequence of S.
# 
# 
# Example :
# Input: 
# S = "abcde"
# words = ["a", "bb", "acd", "ace"]
# Output: 3
# Explanation: There are three words in words that are a subsequence of S: "a",
# "acd", "ace".
# 
# 
# Note:
# 
# 
# All words in words and S will only consists of lowercase letters.
# The length of S will be in the range of [1, 50000].
# The length of words will be in the range of [1, 5000].
# The length of words[i] will be in the range of [1, 50].
