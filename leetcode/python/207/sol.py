1. if node `v` has not been visited, then mark it as `0`.
2. if node `v` is being visited, then mark it as `-1`. If we find a vertex marked as `-1` in DFS, then their is a ring.
3. if node `v` has been visited, then mark it as `1`. If a vertex was marked as `1`, then no ring contains `v` or its successors.
