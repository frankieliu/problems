#
# Given an array A of integers, return the length of the longest arithmetic
# subsequence in A.
#
# Recall that a subsequence of A is a list A[i_1], A[i_2], ..., A[i_k] with 0
# <= i_1 < i_2 < ... < i_k <= A.length - 1, and that a sequence BÂ is arithmetic
# if B[i+1] - B[i] are all the same value (for 0 <= i < B.length - 1).
#
#
#
# Example 1:
#
#
# Input: [3,6,9,12]
# Output: 4
# Explanation:
# The whole array is an arithmetic sequence with steps of length = 3.
#
#
#
# Example 2:
#
#
# Input: [9,4,7,2,10]
# Output: 3
# Explanation:
# The longest arithmetic subsequence is [4,7,10].
#
#
#
# Example 3:
#
#
# Input: [20,1,15,3,10,5,8]
# Output: 4
# Explanation:
# The longest arithmetic subsequence is [20,15,10,5].
#
#
#
#
#
# Note:
#
#
# 2 <= A.length <= 2000
# 0 <= A[i] <= 10000
