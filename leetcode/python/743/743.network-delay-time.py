# There are N network nodes, labelled 1 to N.
# 
# Given times, a list of travel times as directed edges times[i] = (u, v, w),
# where u is the source node, v is the target node, and w is the time it takes
# for a signal to travel from source to target.
# 
# Now, we send a signal from a certain node K. How long will it take for all
# nodes to receive the signal? If it is impossible, return -1.
# 
# Note:
# 
# 
# N will be in the range [1, 100].
# K will be in the range [1, N].
# The length of times will be in the range [1, 6000].
# All edges times[i] = (u, v, w) will have 1 <= u, v <= N and 1 <= w <=
# 100.
