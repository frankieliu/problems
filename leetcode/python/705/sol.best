the purpose of this leetcode question is not to pass all the test.  it is for understanding how hashset or hashmap works under the hood. 

So please do not post any answers using built-in hashset/hashmap, or just use a single array. Ask yourself, are you going to do the same stupid thing if this is the question you are asked in a real interview?
