# Testcase Example:  '"this apple is sweet"\n"this apple is sour"'
#
# We are given two sentences A and B.  (A sentence is a string of space
# separated words.  Each word consists only of lowercase letters.)
# 
# A word is uncommon if it appears exactly once in one of the sentences, and
# does not appear in the other sentence.
# 
# Return a list of all uncommon words. 
# 
# You may return the list in any order.
# 
# 
# 
# 
# 
# 
# 
# Example 1:
# 
# 
# Input: A = "this apple is sweet", B = "this apple is sour"
# Output: ["sweet","sour"]
# 
# 
# 
# Example 2:
# 
# 
# Input: A = "apple apple", B = "banana"
# Output: ["banana"]
# 
# 
# 
# 
# Note:
# 
# 
# 0 <= A.length <= 200
# 0 <= B.length <= 200
# A and B both contain only spaces and lowercase letters.
