* cherry pick
0 1 -1
1 0 -1
1 1  1

1 is a cherry
-1 is a block

He has to return back where he started

maximum number of cherries you can pick with two traversals

The return travel might be a different route

* only allowed move in two directions
0, 0   n-1, n-1

* mistakes
the maximum sequentially is wrong
it must be the max for both traversals

This example illustrates why the maximum of both
is not the best

    1   1
1   1

* second concept
equivalent to two people traversing in the same location

* be careful
just look at the fact that they reach the cell at the same
time, then make sure that you only pick once, i.e. they
reach the same location at the time (intersection)

* can you do bfs?
(2n n) * (2n n)

* dp
dp(x1, y1, x2, y2) cherries picked from x1,y1 and x2,y2 all the
                   way to the end
looking for dp(0,0,0,0)

dp(x1,y1,x2,y2) =  max(
  dp(x1,y1+1,x2,y2+1)
  dp(x1+1,y1,x2+1,y2)
  dp(x1,y1+1,x2+1,y2)
  dp(x1+1,y1,x2,y2+1)
) + g[x1][y1] + g[x2][y2] if x2,y2 != x1,y1
