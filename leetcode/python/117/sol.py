The algorithm is a BFS or level order traversal. We go through the tree level by level. node is the pointer in the parent level, tail is the tail pointer in the child level.
The parent level can be view as a singly linked list or queue, which we can traversal easily with a pointer.
Connect the tail with every one of the possible nodes in child level, update it only if the connected node is not nil.
Do this one level by one level. The whole thing is quite straightforward.

**Python**

    def connect(self, node):
        tail = dummy = TreeLinkNode(0)
        while node:
            tail.next = node.left
            if tail.next:
                tail = tail.next
            tail.next = node.right
            if tail.next:
                tail = tail.next
            node = node.next
            if not node:
                tail = dummy
                node = dummy.next
