/// O(log10(N)) Time & Space
/// The main idea to simplify the implementation is, when count, start with empty then 0's at a certain length;
/// E.g. when do n = 345, k = 250, instead of counting from 1, 10, 100, ...., count from EMPTY, 0, 00, 000, 001, 002..09, 091, 092, ..099, 1
/// Therefore, I count 112 (there is an EMPTY at first) more than you should. So I add this difference first;
/// The reason why I do it this way is it will greatly simplify the implementation later.
/// Suppose I'm in an intermediate round, I have prevdigs = 3. I want to calculate solve(45, 27) now,
/// because there is a leading digit, it makes 0, 00 or even EMPTY valid now -- they can make 30, 300, 3 respectively.
/// So in all intermediate rounds, it's beneficial to consider 0, 00, EMPTY before 1XX. The only exceptional round is the first one.
/// So I just need to do some manipulate with the first round, then we are all good.
