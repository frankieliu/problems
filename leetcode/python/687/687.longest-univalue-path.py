# Given a binary tree, find the length of the longest path where each node in
# the path has the same value. This path may or may not pass through the root.
# 
# Note: The length of path between two nodes is represented by the number of
# edges between them.
# 
# 
# Example 1:
# 
# 
# 
# 
# Input:
# 
# ⁠             5
# ⁠            / \
# ⁠           4   5
# ⁠          / \   \
# ⁠         1   1   5
# 
# 
# 
# 
# Output:
# 
# 2
# 
# 
# 
# 
# Example 2:
# 
# 
# 
# 
# Input:
# 
# ⁠             1
# ⁠            / \
# ⁠           4   5
# ⁠          / \   \
# ⁠         4   4   5
# 
# 
# 
# 
# Output:
# 
# 2
#

# 
# Note:
# The given binary tree has not more than 10000 nodes.  The height of the tree
# is not more than 1000.
