* Idea is simple.
* First item in preorder list is the root to be considered.
* For next item in preorder list, there are 2 cases to consider:
	* If value is less than last item in stack, it is the left child of last item.
	* If value is greater than last item in stack, pop it.
		* The last popped item will be the parent and the item will be the right child of the parent.

        stack = [root]
        for value in preorder[1:]:
            if value < stack[-1].val:
                stack[-1].left = TreeNode(value)
                stack.append(stack[-1].left)
            else:

                    last = stack.pop()
                last.right = TreeNode(value)
