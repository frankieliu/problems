There are so many different approaches and so many different ways to implement each. I find it hard to decide, so here are several :-)

In all of them, I check one of these tree characterizations:

- Has n-1 edges and is acyclic.
- Has n-1 edges and is connected.

**Solution 1** ... **Union-Find**

The test cases are small and harmless, [simple union-find](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disjoint-set_data_structure#Disjoint-set_forests) suffices (runs in about 50~60 ms).

    def validTree(self, n, edges):
        parent = range(n)
        def find(x):
            return x if parent[x] == x else find(parent[x])
        def union(xy):
            x, y = map(find, xy)
            parent[x] = y
            return x != y
        return len(edges) == n-1 and all(map(union, edges))

A version without using `all(...)`, to be closer to other programming languages:

    def validTree(self, n, edges):
        parent = range(n)
        def find(x):
            return x if parent[x] == x else find(parent[x])
        for e in edges:
            x, y = map(find, e)
            if x == y:
                return False
            parent[x] = y
        return len(edges) == n - 1

A version checking `len(edges) != n - 1` first, as `parent = range(n)` could fail for huge `n`:

    def validTree(self, n, edges):
        if len(edges) != n - 1:
            return False
        parent = range(n)
        def find(x):
            return x if parent[x] == x else find(parent[x])
        def union(xy):
            x, y = map(find, xy)
            parent[x] = y
            return x != y
        return all(map(union, edges))

**Solution 2** ... **DFS**

    def validTree(self, n, edges):
        neighbors = {i: [] for i in range(n)}
        for v, w in edges:
            neighbors[v] += w,
            neighbors[w] += v,
        def visit(v):
            map(visit, neighbors.pop(v, []))
        visit(0)
        return len(edges) == n-1 and not neighbors

Or check the number of edges first, to be faster and to survive unreasonably huge `n`:

    def validTree(self, n, edges):
        if len(edges) != n - 1:
            return False
        neighbors = {i: [] for i in range(n)}
        for v, w in edges:
            neighbors[v] += w,
            neighbors[w] += v,
        def visit(v):
            map(visit, neighbors.pop(v, []))
        visit(0)
        return not neighbors

For an iterative version, just replace the three "visit" lines with

        stack = [0]
        while stack:
            stack += neighbors.pop(stack.pop(), [])

**Solution 3** ... **BFS**

Just like DFS above, but replace the three "visit" lines with

        queue = [0]
        for v in queue:
            queue += neighbors.pop(v, [])

or, since that is not guaranteed to work, the safer

        queue = collections.deque([0])
        while queue:
            queue.extend(neighbors.pop(queue.popleft(), []))
