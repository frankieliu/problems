# Testcase Example:  '[34,23,1,24,75,33,54,8]\n60'
#
# Given an array A of integers andÂ integer K, return the maximum S such that
# there exists i < j with A[i] + A[j] = S and S < K. If no i, j exist
# satisfying this equation, return -1.
# 
# 
# 
# Example 1:
# 
# 
# Input: A = [34,23,1,24,75,33,54,8], K = 60
# Output: 58
# Explanation: 
# We can use 34 and 24 to sum 58 which is less than 60.
# 
# 
# Example 2:
# 
# 
# Input: A = [10,20,30], K = 15
# Output: -1
# Explanation: 
# In this case it's not possible to get a pair sum less that 15.
# 
# 
# 
# 
# Note:
# 
# 
# 1 <= A.length <= 100
# 1 <= A[i] <= 1000
# 1 <= K <= 2000
