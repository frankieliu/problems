#
# Given the head of a linked list, we repeatedly delete consecutive sequences
# of nodes that sum to 0 until there are no such sequences.
# 
# After doing so, return the head of the final linked list.Â  You may return any
# such answer.
# 
# 
# (Note that in the examples below, all sequences are serializations of
# ListNode objects.)
# 
# Example 1:
# 
# 
# Input: head = [1,2,-3,3,1]
# Output: [3,1]
# Note: The answer [1,2,1] would also be accepted.
# 
# 
# Example 2:
# 
# 
# Input: head = [1,2,3,-3,4]
# Output: [1,2,4]
# 
# 
# Example 3:
# 
# 
# Input: head = [1,2,3,-3,-2]
# Output: [1]
# 
# 
# 
# Constraints:
# 
# 
# The given linked list will contain between 1 and 1000 nodes.
# Each node in the linked list has -1000 <= node.val <= 1000.
# 
# 
#
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode(object):
#     def __init__(self, x):
#         self.val = x
#         self.next = None
