#
# Given a binary tree, return all root-to-leaf paths.
# 
# Note: A leaf is a node with no children.
# 
# Example:
# 
# 
# Input:
# 
# ⁠  1
# ⁠/   \
# 2     3
# ⁠\
# ⁠ 5
# 
# Output: ["1->2->5", "1->3"]
# 
# Explanation: All root-to-leaf paths are: 1->2->5, 1->3
# 
#
# Definition for a binary tree node.

#         self.val = x
#         self.left = None
#         self.right = None
