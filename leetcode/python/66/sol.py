    def plusOne(digits):
        num = 0
        for i in range(len(digits)):
        	num += digits[i] * pow(10, (len(digits)-1-i))
        return [int(i) for i in str(num+1)]

We're given a list of digits, and the idea here is to convert that list to an integer, *num*. So each digit is multiplied by the proper place value and added to *num*. For example, if *digits* = [3, 8, 2, 5] then on the first iteration 3 is multiplied by 10 to the power of 4-1-0 = 3, so this results in 3000, which is added to *num*. Then 8 is multiplied by 10^2 and added to *num*, and so on.

The last step is to add 1 to *num*, convert it to a list and return that list.
