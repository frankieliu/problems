#
# Given a non-empty binary search tree and a target value, find the value in
# the BST that is closest to the target.
# 
# Note:
# 
# 
# Given target value is a floating point.
# You are guaranteed to have only one unique value in the BST that is closest
# to the target.
# 
# 
# Example:
# 
# 
# Input: root = [4,2,5,1,3], target = 3.714286
# 
# ⁠   4
# ⁠  / \
# ⁠ 2   5
# ⁠/ \
