#
# Given an array A of positive integers (not necessarily distinct), return the
# lexicographically largest permutation that is smaller than A, that can be
# made with one swap (A swap exchanges the positions of two numbers A[i] and
# A[j]).Â  If it cannot be done, then return the same array.
# 
# 
# 
# Example 1:
# 
# 
# Input: [3,2,1]
# Output: [3,1,2]
# Explanation: Swapping 2 and 1.
# 
# 
# Example 2:
# 
# 
# Input: [1,1,5]
# Output: [1,1,5]
# Explanation: This is already the smallest permutation.
# 
# 
# Example 3:
# 
# 
# Input: [1,9,4,6,7]
# Output: [1,7,4,6,9]
# Explanation: Swapping 9 and 7.
# 
# 
# Example 4:
# 
# 
# Input: [3,1,1,3]
# Output: [1,3,1,3]
# Explanation: Swapping 1 and 3.
# 
# 
# 
# 
# Note:
# 
# 
# 1 <= A.length <= 10000
# 1 <= A[i] <= 10000
