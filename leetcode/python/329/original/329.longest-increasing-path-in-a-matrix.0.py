#
# Given an integer matrix, find the length of the longest increasing path.
# 
# From each cell, you can either move to four directions: left, right, up or
# down. You may NOT move diagonally or move outside of the boundary (i.e.
# wrap-around is not allowed).
# 
# Example 1:
# 
# 
# Input: nums = 
# [
# ⁠ [9,9,4],
# ⁠ [6,6,8],
# ⁠ [2,1,1]
# ] 
# Output: 4 
# Explanation: The longest increasing path is [1, 2, 6, 9].
# 
# 
# Example 2:
# 
# 
# Input: nums = 
# [
# ⁠ [3,4,5],
# ⁠ [3,2,6],
# ⁠ [2,2,1]
# ] 
# Output: 4 
# Explanation: The longest increasing path is [3, 4, 5, 6]. Moving diagonally
# is not allowed.
