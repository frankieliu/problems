#
# Given two sequences pushed and popped with distinct values, return true if
# and only if this could have been the result of a sequence of push and pop
# operations on an initially empty stack.
# 
# 
# 
# 
# Example 1:
# 
# 
# Input: pushed = [1,2,3,4,5], popped = [4,5,3,2,1]
# Output: true
# Explanation: We might do the following sequence:
# push(1), push(2), push(3), push(4), pop() -> 4,
# push(5), pop() -> 5, pop() -> 3, pop() -> 2, pop() -> 1
# 
# 
# 
# Example 2:
# 
# 
# Input: pushed = [1,2,3,4,5], popped = [4,3,5,1,2]
# Output: false
# Explanation: 1 cannot be popped before 2.
# 
# 
# 
# 
# Note:
# 
# 
# 0 <= pushed.length == popped.length <= 1000
# 0 <= pushed[i], popped[i] < 1000
# pushed is a permutation of popped.
# pushed and popped have distinct values.
#
