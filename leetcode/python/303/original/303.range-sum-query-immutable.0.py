# Given an integer array nums, find the sum of the elements between indices i
# and j (i â‰¤ j), inclusive.
# 
# Example:
# 
# Given nums = [-2, 0, 3, -5, 2, -1]
# 
# sumRange(0, 2) -> 1
# sumRange(2, 5) -> -1
# sumRange(0, 5) -> -3
# 
# 
# 
# Note:
# 
# You may assume that the array does not change.
# There are many calls to sumRange function.
#
