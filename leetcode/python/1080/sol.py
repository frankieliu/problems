Hello everyone,

~~We have decided to rejudge this problem (140th LeetCode Weekly Contest&#39;s Q3 - Insufficient Nodes in Root to Leaf Paths) because of judging error.~~

~~Only the submissions which got &quot;Wrong Answer&quot; will be rejudged. All the submissions which got &quot;AC&quot; during contest, would be kept as such(even if they are incorrect).~~

~~Contest ranking will be updated as soon as rejudging finishes!~~

Edit: Even though this contest\'s Q3 was rejudged and ranking was updated, after careful consideration, we decided to declare "Weekly Contest 140" as unrated which means it won\'t have any effect on the global ranking. 

We apologize for the quality of some problems in the last few contests. While all our contest problems undergo a review and get tested by several people, a few issues have slipped past our review process.  To prevent such mistakes from happening in the future, we are working on improving our problem review process.
