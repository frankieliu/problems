#
#
# Given a string and a string dictionary, find the longest string in the
# dictionary that can be formed by deleting some characters of the given
# string. If there are more than one possible results, return the longest word
# with the smallest lexicographical order. If there is no possible result,
# return the empty string.
#
# Example 1:
#
# Input:
# s = "abpcplea", d = ["ale","apple","monkey","plea"]
#
# Output:
# "apple"
#
#
#
#
# Example 2:
#
# Input:
# s = "abpcplea", d = ["a","b","c"]
#
# Output:
# "a"
#
#
#
# Note:
#
# All the strings in the input will only contain lower-case letters.
# The size of the dictionary won't exceed 1,000.
# The length of all the strings in the input won't exceed 1,000.
