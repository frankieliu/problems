For the follow-up question, this is O(k log n) and maybe O(k + log n), haven't thought it through yet. Probably by far the longest solution I've posted here, I even felt the need to include comments :-P

Imagine you didn't have a BST but a simple sorted array. How would you find the k values closest to the target value? You could do binary search to find the closest value and then move outwards with two index variables, collecting the k closest values. That's what I do here, except instead of simple array indexes I have two tree iterators in the form of root-to-node paths.

Finding the initial iterator=path to the closest value takes O(h) time, where h is the height of the tree. Increasing or decreasing these iterators=paths also takes O(h) time. So O(kh) overall. And maybe better, as moving an iterator=path will often be quick. I mean, it's just an inorder traversal, so I'd expect O(1) amortized moving time at least if we're traversing the entire tree.

    def closestKValues(self, root, target, k):

        # Helper, takes a path and makes it the path to the next node
        def nextpath(path, kid1, kid2):
            if path:
                if kid2(path):
                    path += kid2(path),
                    while kid1(path):
                        path += kid1(path),
                else:
                    kid = path.pop()
                    while path and kid is kid2(path):
                        kid = path.pop()

        # These customize nextpath as forward or backward iterator
        kidleft = lambda path: path[-1].left
        kidright = lambda path: path[-1].right

        # Build path to closest node
        path = []
        while root:
            path += root,
            root = root.left if target < root.val else root.right
        dist = lambda node: abs(node.val - target)
        path = path[:path.index(min(path, key=dist))+1]

        # Get the path to the next larger node
        path2 = path[:]
        nextpath(path2, kidleft, kidright)

        # Collect the closest k values by moving the two paths outwards
        vals = []
        for _ in range(k):
            if not path2 or path and dist(path[-1]) < dist(path2[-1]):
                vals += path[-1].val,
                nextpath(path, kidright, kidleft)
            else:
                vals += path2[-1].val,
                nextpath(path2, kidleft, kidright)
        return vals
