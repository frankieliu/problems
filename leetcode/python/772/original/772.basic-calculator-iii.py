#
# Implement a basic calculator to evaluate a simple expression string.
# 
# The expression string may contain open ( and closing parentheses ), the plus
# + or minus sign -, non-negative integers and empty spaces  .
# 
# The expression string contains only non-negative integers, +, -, *, /
# operators , open ( and closing parentheses ) and empty spaces  . The integer
# division should truncate toward zero.
# 
# You may assume that the given expression is always valid. All intermediate
# results will be in the range of [-2147483648, 2147483647].
# 
# Some examples:
# 
# 
# "1 + 1" = 2
# " 6-4 / 2 " = 4
# "2*(5+5*2)/3+(6/2+8)" = 21
# "(2+6* 3+5- (3*14/7+2)*5)+3"=-12
# 
# 
# 
# 
# Note: Do not use the eval built-in library function.
