#
# Given a binary search tree (BST) with duplicates, find all the mode(s) (the
# most frequently occurred element) in the given BST.
# 
# Assume a BST is defined as follows:
# 
# 
# The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys less than or equal
# to the node's key.
# The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than or
# equal to the node's key.
# Both the left and right subtrees must also be binary search trees.
# 
# 
# 
# 
# For example:
# Given BST [1,null,2,2],
# 
# 
# ⁠  1
# ⁠   \
# ⁠    2
# ⁠   /
# ⁠  2
# 
# 
# 
# 
# return [2].
# 
# Note: If a tree has more than one mode, you can return them in any order.
# 
# Follow up: Could you do that without using any extra space? (Assume that the
# implicit stack space incurred due to recursion does not count).
# 
#
# Definition for a binary tree node.

#     def __init__(self, x):
#         self.val = x
#         self.left = None
#         self.right = None
