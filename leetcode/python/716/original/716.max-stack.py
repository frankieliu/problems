#
# Design a max stack that supports push, pop, top, peekMax and popMax.
# 
# 
# 
# push(x) -- Push element x onto stack.
# pop() -- Remove the element on top of the stack and return it.
# top() -- Get the element on the top.
# peekMax() -- Retrieve the maximum element in the stack.
# popMax() -- Retrieve the maximum element in the stack, and remove it. If you
# find more than one maximum elements, only remove the top-most one.
# 
# 
# 
# Example 1:
# 
# MaxStack stack = new MaxStack();
# stack.push(5); 
# stack.push(1);
# stack.push(5);
# stack.top(); -> 5
# stack.popMax(); -> 5
# stack.top(); -> 1
# stack.peekMax(); -> 5
# stack.pop(); -> 1
# stack.top(); -> 5
# 
# 
# 
# Note:
# 
# -1e7 
# Number of operations won't exceed 10000.
# The last four operations won't be called when stack is empty.
