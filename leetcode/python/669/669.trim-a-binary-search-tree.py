# 
# Given a binary search tree and the lowest and highest boundaries as L and R,
# trim the tree so that all its elements lies in [L, R] (R >= L). You might
# need to change the root of the tree, so the result should return the new root
# of the trimmed binary search tree.
# 
# 
# Example 1:
# 
# Input: 
# ⁠   1
# ⁠  / \
# ⁠ 0   2
# 
# ⁠ L = 1
# ⁠ R = 2
# 
# Output: 
# ⁠   1
# ⁠     \
# ⁠      2
# 
# 
# 
# Example 2:
# 
# Input: 
# ⁠   3
# ⁠  / \
# ⁠ 0   4
# ⁠  \
# ⁠   2
# ⁠  /
# ⁠ 1
# 
# ⁠ L = 1
# ⁠ R = 3
# 
# Output: 
# ⁠     3
# ⁠    / 
# ⁠  2
