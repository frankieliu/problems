#
# Given two integers A and B, return any string S such that:
# 
# 
# S has length A + B and contains exactly A 'a' letters, and exactly B 'b'
# letters;
# The substring 'aaa' does not occur in S;
# The substring 'bbb' does not occur in S.
# 
# 
# 
# 
# Example 1:
# 
# 
# Input: A = 1, B = 2
# Output: "abb"
# Explanation: "abb", "bab" and "bba" are all correct answers.
# 
# 
# 
# Example 2:
# 
# 
# Input: A = 4, B = 1
# Output: "aabaa"
# 
# 
# 
# 
# Note:
# 
# 
# 0 <= A <= 100
# 0 <= B <= 100
# It is guaranteed such an S exists for the given A and B.
