# Testcase Example:  '[-2,5,-1]\n-2\n2'
#
# Given an integer array nums, return the number of range sums that lie in
# [lower, upper] inclusive.
# Range sum S(i, j) is defined as the sum of the elements in nums between
# indices i and j (i â‰¤ j), inclusive.
# 
# Note:
# A naive algorithm of O(n^2) is trivial. You MUST do better than that.
# 
# Example:
# 
# 
# Input: nums = [-2,5,-1], lower = -2, upper = 2,
# Output: 3 
# Explanation: The three ranges are : [0,0], [2,2], [0,2] and their respective
# sums are: -2, -1, 2.
