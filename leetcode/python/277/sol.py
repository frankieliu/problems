**Explanation**

The first loop is to exclude `n - 1` labels that are not possible to be a celebrity. 
After the first loop, `x` is the only candidate.
The second and third loop is to verify `x` is actually a celebrity by definition.

The key part is the first loop. To understand this you can think the `knows(a,b)` as a `a < b` comparison, if `a` knows `b` then `a < b`, if `a` does not know `b`, `a > b`. Then if there is a celebrity, he/she must be the "maximum" of the `n` people.

However, the "maximum" may not be the celebrity in the case of no celebrity at all. Thus we need the second and third loop to check if `x` is actually celebrity by definition.

The total calls of knows is thus `3n` at most. One small improvement is that in the second loop we only need to check i in the range `[0, x)`. You can figure that out yourself easily.
