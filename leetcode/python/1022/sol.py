For a given K, we evaluate `1 % K, 11 % K, 111 % K, ..., 11...1 (K \'1\'s) % K`. 
* If any remainder is 0, then the current number is the smallest integer divisible by `K`. 
* If none of the remainders is 0, then at some point, there must be some duplicate remainders (due to [Pigeonhole principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pigeonhole_principle)), as the `K` remainders can only take at most `K-1` different values excluding 0. In this case, no number with the pattern 1...1 is divisible by `K`. This is because once a remainder has a duplicate, the next remainder will be in a loop, as the previous remainder determines the next_mod, i.e., `next_mod = (10 * prev_mod + 1) % K`. Therefore, we will never see remainder==0.

A simple example is when K is 6. Once we see 1111 % 6 = 1, we immediately know 11111 % 6 will be 5, since 1 % 6 = 1 and 11 % 6 = 5. Therefore, there will be no such number that is divisible by 6.
* 1 % 6 = 1
* 11 % 6 = 5
* 111 % 6 = 3
* 1111 % 6 = 1
* 11111 % 6 = 5
* 111111 % 6 = 3

Also, it is easy to see that for any number whose last digit is not in `{1, 3, 7, 9}`, we should return `-1`.

class Solution:
    def smallestRepunitDivByK(self, K: int) -> int:
        if K % 10 not in {1, 3, 7, 9}: return -1
        mod, mod_set = 0, set()
        for length in range(1, K + 1):
            mod = (10 * mod + 1) % K
            if mod == 0: return length
            if mod in mod_set: return -1
            mod_set.add(mod)
        return -1
```
