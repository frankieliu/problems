**Idea:** Reflect the points by replacing every x with minX+maxX-x and then check whether you get the same points. Why minX+maxX-x? I actually thought of it as minX+(maxX-x), i.e., first the subtraction (maxX-x). That's how far x is away from the max, so instead go that distance from the min.

**Update to reflect the changed problem:** (Originally, the problem was about a set of points, so no duplicates.)
```
def is_reflected(points)
  points.sort!.uniq == points.map { |x, y| [points[0][0] + points[-1][0] - x, y] }.sort.uniq
end
```
```
def isReflected(self, points):
    points = sorted(set(map(tuple, points)))
    return points == sorted((points[0][0] + points[-1][0] - x, y)
                            for x, y in points)
```

**Ruby**

    def is_reflected(points)
      points.sort! == points.map { |x, y| [points[0][0] + points[-1][0] - x, y] }.sort
    end

---

**Python**

    def isReflected(self, points):
        points.sort()
        return points == sorted([points[0][0] + points[-1][0] - x, y]
                                for x, y in points)

A linear time one:

    def isReflected(self, points):
        if not points: return True
        X = min(points)[0] + max(points)[0]
        return {(x, y) for x, y in points} == {(X - x, y) for x, y in points}

Shorter, but I think less nice:

        return set(map(tuple, points)) == {(X - x, y) for x, y in points}
