* problem
1 3 2 3 1
  *     *
      * *

s.t.  i < j and a[i] > 2 a[j]

(3, 1), (3, 1)

* brute
O(n^2) brute force linear scan

* BST
for some j
assume that left of j is kept in a BST
1. create a BST at each step
2. iterate and searh an binary search in previously sorted
3. augmented BST

* merge sort
132 | 31

3 4 7  |  1 3
i         j

move enough indices
3 > 2(1)

move j to the right, it doesn't satisfy
3 4 7 | 1 3
i         j   count += 1

merge allows you to solve this problem

* another solution
3 4 7 | 1 2 3
i       j

find the i that meets the criteria then count number on left
then move j then move i until it meets the criteria, etc

This works as well
