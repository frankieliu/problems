# Testcase Example:  '["abcw","baz","foo","bar","xtfn","abcdef"]'
#
# Given a string array words, find the maximum value of length(word[i]) *
# length(word[j]) where the two words do not share common letters. You may
# assume that each word will contain only lower case letters. If no such two
# words exist, return 0.
# 
# Example 1:
# 
# 
# Input: ["abcw","baz","foo","bar","xtfn","abcdef"]
# Output: 16 
# Explanation: The two words can be "abcw", "xtfn".
# 
# Example 2:
# 
# 
# Input: ["a","ab","abc","d","cd","bcd","abcd"]
# Output: 4 
# Explanation: The two words can be "ab", "cd".
# 
# Example 3:
# 
# 
# Input: ["a","aa","aaa","aaaa"]
# Output: 0 
# Explanation: No such pair of words.
