Treat this problem as two problems merged:
1. generate a sequence of parentheses and commas in this format:
(((,),(,)),((,),(,)))
2. generated a sequence of numbers in this order:
1,16,8,9,4,13..6,11

This is actually literally how I coded the algorithm below.

For the 1st problem, I think it's a typical medium level LC problems, not much to explain. Keep a stack of current symbols and pop things properly.

For the 2nd problem, things are a little bit obscure, but it can be solved by keeping a stack too. Let's take n = 16 as an example to how my algorithm works.
1. The first one is always 1, generate it and then push the sum of 1+n to the stack together with 1:
Result:1,     Stack:(17, 1) // (17, 1) is one single element in the stack.
2. The second one can be calculated by 17 - 1 = 16. Add 16 to the result and update the stack's top by halving its value (9 = 17/2 + 1). Then push the new value onto stack too.
Result:1,16,  Stack:(9, 1), (17, 16) //17 is still the sum of n+1, and 16 is the 2nd value; 9 is obtained by 9 = 17/2 + 1
3. Now we meet our first ')', pop the stack:
Result:1,16, Stack: (9,1)
4. The third one can be calculated the same as step 2: Use stack top pair: 9 - 1 = 8, and then halving the stack's top value (5 = 9/2 + 1), and then push the new value to the stack.
Result:1, 16, 8, Stack: (5, 1),(17, 8)   // 5 = 9/2 + 1
5. The forth one is same: Use stack top pair: 17 - 8 = 9, halve 17 and push the new value in:
Result,1, 16, 8, 9, Stack:(5,1),(9,8),(17,9)
6. Now we meet ')', pop stack:
Result,1, 16, 8, 9, Stack:(5,1),(9,8)
7. It's still ')', keep popping:
Result,1, 16, 8, 9, Stack:(5,1)
8. Next element: 5 - 1 = 4, halve top and push (17, 4) in
Result,1, 16, 8, 9, 4, Stack:(3,1),(17, 4)
9. Next element: 17 - 4 = 13, halve top and push (17, 13) in
Result,1, 16, 8, 9, 4, 13 Stack:(3,1),(9, 4),(17, 13)
10. meet ')', pop stack:
Result,1, 16, 8, 9, 4, 13 Stack:(3,1),(9, 4)
11. Next element 9-4 = 5, halve top and push (17, 5) in
Result,1, 16, 8, 9, 4, 13, 5 Stack:(3,1),(9, 4),(17, 5)
12. Next element 17 - 5 = 12, do the same things:
Result,1, 16, 8, 9, 4, 13, 5, 12 Stack:(3,1),(9, 4),(9, 5)
13. See ')' Pop stack;
14.  See ')' Pop stack;

15. Generate 3-1 = 2;

16. Generate 17-2 = 15;
