# Testcase Example:  '[1,2,3,1]\n3\n0'
#
# Given an array of integers, find out whether there are two distinct indices i
# and j in the array such that the absolute difference between nums[i] and
# nums[j] is at most t and the absolute difference between i and j is at most
# k.
# 
# 
# Example 1:
# 
# 
# Input: nums = [1,2,3,1], k = 3, t = 0
# Output: true
# 
# 
# 
# Example 2:
# 
# 
# Input: nums = [1,0,1,1], k = 1, t = 2
# Output: true
# 
# 
# 
# Example 3:
# 
# 
# Input: nums = [1,5,9,1,5,9], k = 2, t = 3
# Output: false
