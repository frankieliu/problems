    def largestDivisibleSubset(self, nums):
        S = {-1: set()}
        for x in sorted(nums):
            S[x] = max((S[d] for d in S if x % d == 0), key=len) | {x}
        return list(max(S.values(), key=len))

My `S[x]` is the largest subset with `x` as the largest element, i.e., the subset of all divisors of `x` in the input. With `S[-1] = emptyset` as useful base case. Since divisibility is transitive, a multiple `x` of some divisor `d` is also a multiple of all elements in `S[d]`, so it's not necessary to explicitly test divisibility of `x` by all elements in `S[d]`. Testing `x % d` suffices.

While storing entire subsets isn't super efficient, it's also not that bad. To extend a subset, the new element must be divisible by all elements in it, meaning it must be at least twice as large as the largest element in it. So with the 31-bit integers we have here, the largest possible set has size 31 (containing all powers of 2).
