`level` is a list of the nodes in the current level. Keep appending a list of the values of these nodes to `ans` and then updating `level` with all the nodes in the next level (kids) until it reaches an empty level. Python's list comprehension makes it easier to deal with many conditions in a concise manner.

Solution 1, (6 lines)

    def levelOrder(self, root):
        ans, level = [], [root]
        while root and level:
            ans.append([node.val for node in level])
            LRpair = [(node.left, node.right) for node in level]
            level = [leaf for LR in LRpair for leaf in LR if leaf]
        return ans

Solution 2, (5 lines), same idea but use only one list comprehension in while loop to get the next level

    def levelOrder(self, root):
        ans, level = [], [root]
        while root and level:
            ans.append([node.val for node in level])            
            level = [kid for n in level for kid in (n.left, n.right) if kid]
        return ans

Solution 3 (10 lines), just an expansion of solution 1&2 for better understanding.

    def levelOrder(self, root):
        if not root:
            return []
        ans, level = [], [root]
        while level:
            ans.append([node.val for node in level])
            temp = []
            for node in level:
                temp.extend([node.left, node.right])
            level = [leaf for leaf in temp if leaf]
        return ans
