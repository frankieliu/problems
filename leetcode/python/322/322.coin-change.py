# Testcase Example:  '[1,2,5]\n11'
#
# You are given coins of different denominations and a total amount of money
# amount. Write a function to compute the fewest number of coins that you need
# to make up that amount. If that amount of money cannot be made up by any
# combination of the coins, return -1.
# 
# Example 1:
# 
# 
# Input: coins = [1, 2, 5], amount = 11
# Output: 3 
# Explanation: 11 = 5 + 5 + 1
# 
# Example 2:
# 
# 
# Input: coins = [2], amount = 3
# Output: -1
# 
# 
# Note:
# You may assume that you have an infinite number of each kind of coin.
