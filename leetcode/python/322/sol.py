This solution is inspired by the BFS solution for problem [Perfect Square][1]. Since it is to find the least coin solution (like a shortest path from 0 to amount), using BFS gives results much faster than DP.

    class Solution(object):
        def coinChange(self, coins, amount):
            """
            :type coins: List[int]
            :type amount: int
            :rtype: int
            """
            if amount == 0:
                return 0
            value1 = [0]
            value2 = []
            nc =  0
            visited = [False]*(amount+1)
            visited[0] = True
            while value1:
                nc += 1
                for v in value1:
                    for coin in coins:
                        newval = v + coin
                        if newval == amount:
                            return nc
                        elif newval > amount:
                            continue
                        elif not visited[newval]:
                            visited[newval] = True
                            value2.append(newval)
                value1, value2 = value2, []
            return -1
