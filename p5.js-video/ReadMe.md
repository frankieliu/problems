# Hello P5

Design and development of this demo was lead by [Scott Garner](http://scott.j38.net/) with input and contributions from [Dan Shiffman](http://shiffman.net/) and support from [NYU ITP](http://itp.nyu.edu). Demo sketches were written by Dan and Scott.

[Popcorn.js](http://popcornjs.org/), part of Mozilla's [Popcorn Project](https://popcorn.webmaker.org/), is used to trigger Javascript events in sync with the video. Realtime compositing of the presenters is done with [Seriously.js](http://seriouslyjs.org/), created by Brian Chirls with support from Mozilla.

Other libraries and frameworks used in this project include [Twitter Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com) and [jQuery](http://jquery.com). Icons are from Dave Gandy's [Font Awesome](http://fontawesome.io/).
