* compiling and running locally
** installation
googletest, glog, bazel
1. all were installed via aptitude
2. googletest had to go through a few more steps to create
   libraries that were manually installed into /usr/lib
** running
1. c++/ is the workspace directory
2. WORKSPACE defines the "external" dependencies
   1. since I have local installs for googletest,
      need to point them in WORKSPACE, this is in 
      lieu of downloading them
   2. googletest also requires use of pthread library
      this was also added in WORKSPACE
3. In each "leetcode" problem directory such as 67
   for add-binary problem, there is a BUILD file the
   build dependencies
4. Put solution in leetcode_<#>.h
5. Put assertion in leetcode_<#>_test.cpp
6. Run bazel test leetcode_<#>_test
7. In order to see the outputs need to add to tools/bazel.rc
   test --test-output=all, this can also be added to WORKSPACE
   directory as .bazelrc
8. Notes: most of the time was spent in 2. trying to figure
   out how to properly reference local libraries

* string functions
string.c_str() : returns const char*
string.length()
string.resize("size",'char')
string.substr("first position","length")

* googletest

EXPECT_STREQ(str.c_str(), (const char*) "some string");
** libgtest vs libgtest_main
libgtest_main.a has a main in it already

* bazel local libraries
